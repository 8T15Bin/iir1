This demo shows how the filter is set up, how data is
processed sample by sample and how the frequency responses
look like with the help of a python script.

Impulse responses of different filters:
./iirdemo
python3 plot_impulse_fresponse.py

50Hz removal from an ECG:
./ecg50hzfilt
python3 plot_ecg_filt.py
