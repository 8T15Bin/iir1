This is a library which implements a variety of IIR filters.

Installation is done with the standard sequence:
CXXFLAGS="-O3 -march=native" ./configure
make
sudo make install
sudo ldconfig

Usage is very simple. A demo program is in the
"demo" directory which demonstrates
a lowpass and a highpass filter. A delta pulse
is sent into the filters and saved as a gnuplot/octave
file. For the documentation have a look at
Documentation.txt

This library has been adapted form Vinnie Falco's
original work which can be found here:
https://github.com/vinniefalco/DSPFilters

The main advancement from the original library is
the implementation of the "filter" function
so that the IIR filter can be used in realime
applications. This has been achieved by just
re-shuffling existing code and making it available
to the user in form of the API call "filter".

Enjoy!
